      <img src="assets/images/headshot.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="Liam Sweeney">

      <p>Liam Sweeney was born in New Haven, Connecticut to a family that – wonderful as they may be – couldn’t draw a straight line with a ruler. Shocked by Liam’s early drawings, his parents first made sure there hadn’t been a switch at the hospital, and then encouraged him to develop and explore his artistic inclinations. He’s been doing so ever since.

          <p>Liam is a graphic designer with a focus on branding, packaging and web design. In addition to being well versed in Adobe Creative Suite, Liam is a front-end developer with fluency in HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript and jQuery.</p>

          <p>Liam's recent clients include: Bulltoro Watches, Upset Gentlemen, The Miami City Ballet, Teach For America Miami-Dade, ESPN, Dress For Success Miami, Robert K. Futterman & Associates, Terranova Corporation, Marriott, Hilton, and Disney's The Lion King Website.</p>
